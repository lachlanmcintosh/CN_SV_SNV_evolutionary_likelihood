# finalise code to fully compare the results with the truth.
	# the chromosome per chromosome functions should be mostly done, just need to write simple functions to average over results.

# find a way to record the likelihood contributions from the tree structe with and without the SNVs. 
# The tree structure and the snvs are jointly dependent so it is not nessecarily meaningful to break this down but it will give an idea as to how the algo is working
