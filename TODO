# this can be used as continually updated TODO list

# add the ability to optimise over the pup and pdown parameters in the finer tree structures
	# not all values need to be considered, probably just a small window of parameters around the estimated maximum
	# a search distance of +-5 would only cost 5^2=25 or +-10 would only cost 100 rather than the full reevaluation 
	# of 5050 (as calculated with the code below)

	# sum = 0
	# for i in range(1, 102):
	# 	sum += i * (101 - i + 1)

	# the cost of optimising over these values is significiant if we have to jointly optimise for the lambda paramter,
	# it is probably better to heirarchically model this and optimise the branching process alone, and then update the 
	# likelihood with the SNV values

# add code that can optimise over the lambda parameters rather than the roughly grid approach currently used
	# maybe half half, use a sparse grid that you search for local maxima around

# finalise code to fully compare the results with the truth.
	# the chromosome per chromosome functions should be mostly done, just need to write simple functions to average over results.

# treat the p_up,p_down and lambda optimisation problem with a convex solver. see how quick it can be done in an off the shelf library.
# I don't nessecarily know if it is a convex problem but it might work well in practise anyway.
